With these we journey back in time to the time of the pioneers and sing with them the songs that collectively were honey in their mouths as they awaited the coming of the Lord (which coming is much nearer now) and also gladdened their experience after the disappointment.\n\nDetect The Changes\n---\nSome of the songs in these hymnals have undergone several changes over the years. Some have been shortened or lengthened by the removal or addition of stanzas. Changes have also "lowered the keys of some of the tunes, thus taking a strain off many vocal cords". ([Standish, Half A Century of Apostasy, pp. 129](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XRxArmcJvEDNOKJkSIs5mtne4SMnTav8/view?usp=sharing)). Yet some still teach doctrines opposed to those held by the old (pioneer) adventists as can be seen from the versions of the songs they sang. Advent Hymnals provides you with a most handy tool to make these comparisons so you can decide for yourself the best versions of the songs that you sing, both in length and in soundness of doctrine.\n\nLet\'s take "Holy, Holy, Holy" for instance. Here is a comparison of the different versions in the 3 hymnals used since 1908:\n\nChanges in Holy, Holy, Holy\n---\nChrist in Song(1908) [#327](/christ-in-song/301-400/321-330/Holy,-Holy)| Church Hymnal(1941) [#73](/church-hymnal/001-100/071-080/Holy,-Holy,-Holy) | SDAH(1985) [#73](/seventh-day-adventist-hymnal/001-100/071-080/Holy,-Holy,-Holy)|\n| ---------------------- | -----------------------| ----------- |\n| Holy, holy, holy!

If you open a song with a tune that you know, you will be shown other songs with the same tune. While this can be found on the index of tunes, showing these songs together provides an additional means of attracting attention to the unfamiliar song. Other tools available include:\n\n- Sheet Music (with staff notation) \n- Tonic sol-fa notation\n- Midi (You can select the voices that you want to play)\n- Vocalised mp3 (Mostly computer generated renditions of the songs in which you can select the voice that you want to play.)\n- Links to audio renditions of songs (These are of better quality that the computer generated audio).\n\nPrinting\n---\nAdvent Hymnals enables you to bundle together a single hymnal, multiple hymnals, or a collection of songs in multiple hymnals for printing.\n\nSeveral Languages\n---\nAdvent Hymnals provides hymnals from several languages. In case your language is missing, you can [contact us](/contacts) so that we can add it.\n\n::: info Corrections\nWhile we are keen to have this all up as soon as possible, it may still take a long time to finish. As such there will me missing hymns, tunes, and tools for some hymns. There will also be ==errros ni te hymns==. In case you spot these, please [get in touch](/contacts) with us so that we can make the appropriate corrections.\n:::\n            ')]),o("q-page-scroller",{attrs:{position:"bottom-right","scroll-offset":150,offset:[18,18]}},[o("q-btn",{attrs:{fab:"",icon:"keyboard_arrow_up",color:"secondary"}})],1)],1)},s=[],a=o("63bb"),i={name:"adventHymnalsHome",components:{},props:["adventHymnals","sideBarOpener"],data(){return{}},async created(){},methods:{onExtend(e){e.use(a["a"])}},computed:{}},l=i,h=(o("022a"),o("2877")),r=o("9989"),y=o("5096"),d=o("9c40"),c=o("eebe"),m=o.n(c),u=Object(h["a"])(l,t,s,!1,null,null,null);n["default"]=u.exports;m()(u,"components",{QPage:r["a"],QPageScroller:y["a"],QBtn:d["a"]})}}]);
